From Gnome Extensions Repository

Visit [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4994/dash2dock-lite/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4994/dash2dock-lite/)

## Theme Support

Export your settings under Style > Themes Button > "Export"...

This will be saved to ```/tmp/theme.json```. Edit this json file and save under ```~/.config/d2da/themes``` or at ```{extension_path}/dash2dock-animated/themes``` so that it becomes available at the extension settings app.

## Custom Icons

Create a folder under ```sh~/.config/d2da/icons``` and place here your SVG icons. Then create a file under ```sh~/.config/d2da/icons.json``` and create a mapping file with the following format:

```json
{
  "icons": {
     "view-app-grid-symbolic": "icons/show-apps-icon.svg",
     "user-trash": "icons/my-own-trash.svg",
     "user-trash-full": "icons/my-own-trash-full.svg"
  }
}
```

You may also use **icon names** from your favorite icon theme. And use the following format:

```json
{
  "icons": {
     "view-app-grid-symbolic": "show-apps-icon",
     "user-trash": "trash",
     "user-trash-full": "trash-full"
  }
}
```

The icons ```show-apps-icon, trash, trash-full``` must be available on your icons theme folder. 

Alternatively, you may override icons via app id:

```json
{
   "apps": {
      "spotify_spotify": "icons/spotify.svg"
   }
}
```

Check the log to see the icon names currently being used by Dash2Dock Animated. Search for log text such assets

```sh
Icon created "user-trash"
```

## Blurred Background

Blurred background feature requires **imagemagick** to be install in the system. This generates the blurred image based of the desktop wallpaper.

## Gnome 42, 43, 44

Build and install Dash2Dock Animated for prior versions (before Gnome 45)

```make g44```

## Bug Reporting

When reporting bugs. Please indicate the following:

* Linux Flavor/Distribution and version
* Gnome version (45.xx)
* Dash2Dock Animated release number

Check for any exceptions in the logs by running the following at the terminal:

```sh
journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell -f -o cat
```

To check incompatibilities with other extensions, try running Dash2Dock Animated with other extensions disabled.

To check for lag or inefficiency. Run the following in the terminal and observer gnome-shell CPU usage.

```sh
top -d 0.5
```

On my old Dell XPS13 i5-6200U. CPU usage is about 50% with icons quality high, frame rate high, shadows on.

Please be specific on the errors encountered. Add screenshots whenever possible.
