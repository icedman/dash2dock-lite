```
- Use the `Makefile` to build and install
```bash 
$ cd dash2dock-lite
$ make
```

Using the AUR (Arch User Repository):
*This requires an Arch-based distribution to work:*

```

From Gnome Extensions Repository

Visit [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4994/dash2dock-lite/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4994/dash2dock-lite/)

## Theme Support

Export your settings under Style > Themes Button > "Export"...

This will be saved to ```/tmp/theme.json```. Edit this json file and save under ```~/.config/d2da/themes``` or at ```{extension_path}/dash2dock-animated/themes``` so that it becomes available at the extension settings app.

## Dynamic Icons

Dynamic trash icon is supported (beta). The first time this is enabled, a GNOME shell restart is required.

The trash icon has an action "Empty Trash" which requires a script *{EXTENSION_PATH}/apps/empty-trash.sh* with the content:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/sh
rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*
```

Modify the script to match your system if necessary. And make sure that the script is executable:

```sh
chmod +x {EXTENSION_PATH}/apps/empty-trash.sh
```

## Bug Reporting

When reporting bugs. Please indicate the following:

* Linux Flavor/Distribution and version
* Gnome version (45.xx)
* Dash2Dock Animated release number

Check for any exceptions in the logs by running the following at the terminal:

```sh
journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell -f -o cat
```

To check incompatibilities with other extensions, try running Dash2Dock Animated with other extensions disabled.

To check for lag or inefficiency. Run the following in the terminal and observer gnome-shell CPU usage.

```sh
top -d 0.5
```

On my old Dell XPS13 i5-6200U. CPU usage is about 50% with icons quality high, frame rate high, shadows on.

Please be specific on the errors encountered. Add screenshots whenever possible.

## Testing Rig

* Arch Linux (Primary development machine)
* Ubuntu 23.10 (Gnome 45)
* Debian 12.x (Gnome 43.9)
* Gnome OS Nightly (virtual, Gnome 46)
* Fedora 39 (virtual)
